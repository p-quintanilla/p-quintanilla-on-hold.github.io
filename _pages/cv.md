# Work experience

* 2022 -  now: **Research Associate in Process Systems Engineering**, Sargent Centre for Process Systems Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London.

* 2021 - now:	**Co-founder and developer of BubbleAnalyser** - the first open-source software for bubble size analysis. 

* Dec 2022: **Guest lecturer**, Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College London. Module: Mining Geology & Engineering. 

* Nov 2022:	**Research Assistant in Froth Flotation**, Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College London.

* Jun - Sept 2022: **Co-supervisor** of an **MSc in Applied Computational Science student**, Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College London. Project: “_Bubble Analyser - Identification and characterisation of bubbles using Machine Learning_”.

* 2017-2018: **Guest lecturer**, Department of Chemical Engineering,  Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Santiago, Chile.:
  * Modules:
     1. **Process Control Seminar:** I taught basic theory on feedback control. The main part of this course was for students to set up an experimental rig from         the calibration of instruments to its connection to PLCs, control logic, and create an HMI (human-machine interface) using Intouch Wonderware software.
     2. **Statistical Design and Analysis of Industrial Experiments**: Applied Statistics and probability for engineers, including continuous random variables and probability distributions, joint probability distributions, statistic intervals, test of hypotheses,  statistical inference for two samples, linear regression, and design of experiments with several factors.

* 2017-2018: **Co-supervisor** of **two final-year engineering projects**, Department of Chemical Engineering,  Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Santiago, Chile.
  * Projects:
     1. _"Incorporation of disturbance estimation in real-time optimisation systems for process supervision"._
     2. _"Implementation of nested modifier adaptation for real-time optimisation under disturbances"._

* 2017-2018: **Research Assistant**, Department of Chemical Engineering,  Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Santiago, Chile. Project: Including stochastic information in Real-Time Optimization for process supervision
  
**Interships in Process Engineering:**
  * Jan/Feb 2014 - Jan/Feb 2016 INACAL S.A, Cementos Bío-Bío (Cement and Lime Industry), Copiapó, Chile.
  * Aug/Sept 2016 Empresa Nacional del Petróleo (Petrochemical Industry), Concón, Chile.
