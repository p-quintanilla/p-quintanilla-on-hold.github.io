Over the past 10+ years, I've participated in a variety of outreach activities that have allowed me to connect with and positively impact diverse communities. These experiences have taught me the value of communication, collaboration, and community engagement, and I'm eager to continue exploring new opportunities to give back and create meaningful change. 

Some of my public engagement and volunteer experiences are:

* 2023: I was part of the **Postdoc Committee at the Chemical Engineering Department** at Imperial College London. I specifically helped with social media, organising events, and being a newsletter editor. 

* 2021 - 2023: I was part of the **London and South East Coast Group Member, Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE)**, United Kingdom. I contributed as a meeting coordinator and newsletter editor. 

* March 2023 - Chaired a session in the **Towards Net Zero Seminar**, held in the Chemical Engineering Department at Imperial College London. 

* Feb 2023: I was one of the four speakers for a **talk on [Inspiring Chemical Engineering â€“ How to stand out](https://www.icheme.org/membership/communities/member-groups/london-and-south-east-coast-young-members/events/28-02-23-inspiring-chemical-engineering-how-to-stand-out/)** given at a **London-based school**. This initiative was organised by IChemE.

* November 2022 - Chaired a session at the **Process Mineralogy conference** in Sitges, Spain. The event was organised by Minerals Engineering International. 

* March 2022 - **STEM for Britain 2022** finalist in the Engineering category. I was thrilled to participate in STEM for Britain, a prestigious scientific poster competition and exhibition for early career researchers, held on 7th March at the Houses of Parliament. It was an extremely competitive process, and I was honored to be selected as one of the 33 finalists to represent the field of Engineering. My poster was focused on mineral resources/processing - a timely and important topic. I was proud to be the only participant to present work in this field. It was a unique opportunity to not only present to a panel of experts but to also share my research with a range of politicians.

* 2021 - 2022: Ambassador of the **Society of Chemical Industry** 

* June 2019 - Volunteer at **Exhibition Road Festival** organised by Imperial College London. 

* 2013 - 2016: I participated in an organisation with which we collected money to buy food for homeless people from Valparaiso (Chile), as well as to programme activities for orphaned children from the National Service for Children (in Spanish: SENAME) and some activities in nursing homes. My responsibilities included promoting the organisation, collecting money and donations, buying food and/or clothes when necessary, and distributing donations to people in need.

* 2011 - 2016: I participated in a voluntary organization called "AccionEduca", which aims to provide academic support to students in a low-financial income school in Valparaiso, Chile. My responsibilities were to provide academic support in a public school and teach Maths and Spanish (grammar) every Friday and Saturday, to children between 8 and 14 years.
