I am a **Lecturer in Process Systems Engineering Engineering** in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Brunel University London.

I obtained MEng and MSc degrees in Chemical Engineering from [Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María](https://www.usm.cl) in Valparaíso, Chile. I completed my PhD in Earth Science and Engineering in the [Advanced Minerals Processing Research Group](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/earth-science/research/research-groups/amprg/) at Imperial College London. I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher in supply chain optimisation for the [Future Targeted Healthcare Manufacturing Hub](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biochemical-engineering/research/research-and-training-centres/future-targeted-healthcare-manufacturing-hub) in the [Sargent Centre for Process Systems Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/process-systems-engineering/), Department of Chemical Engineering at Imperial College London in 2023.

My research interests include the application of computer-aided tools for **modelling, control and optimisation** of a wide range of processes with a sustainable focus:
